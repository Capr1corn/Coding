Coding
======

To improve my coding skills, I did a little practice in a few websites (codility, leetcode, ...). The main reason for creating this repo is that I want to record all the "mind working" in this process. 


It would be great if anyone can join me, so feel free to make your pull request to this repository.  
[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14680711/how-to-do-a-github-pull-request) is a great tutorial answered by tim peterson in stackoverflow. What you need to do is very simple.
